- [ ] `cohorts` table (`id`, `name`, `intake_week`, `created_at`) — weekly intake groups
- [ ] `cohort_members` table (`cohort_id`, `user_id`, `joined_at`) — member-to-cohort mapping
- [ ] Seed starter quest pack in `quests` table (complete profile, submit first task, vote on proposal)

**API:**
- [ ] `GET /api/onboarding/steps` — fetch current member's onboarding progress
- [ ] `POST /api/onboarding/steps/:step/complete` — mark a step complete, trigger XP reward
- [ ] `POST /api/cohorts/assign` — auto-assign new member to current week's cohort on first login
- [ ] `GET /api/cohorts/current` — get calling user's active cohort + member list
- [ ] `GET /api/cohorts/:id/leaderboard` — XP leaderboard scoped to cohort members

**UI:**

- [ ] Cohort widget on dashboard: cohort name, member avatars, XP leaderboard, days left in cohort period
- [ ] Cohort badge on profile card (visible during first 30 days)
- [ ] Notification when cohort opens and when it closes with a summary

---

### Phase 21 — Task Threads + Co-crediting

**Goal:** Make collaboration visible inside the platform. Replace the silence between task creation and completion with threaded discussion and shared XP credit.

**DB:**
- [ ] `task_comments` table (`id`, `task_id`, `user_id`, `content`, `parent_id`, `edited_at`, `deleted_at`, `created_at`) — threaded comments, soft delete
- [ ] `task_collaborators` table (`task_id`, `user_id`, `credited_by`, `xp_share_pct`, `created_at`) — co-contributor credits at submission

- [ ] Notification to mentioned users and co-contributors

---

### Phase 22 — Advanced Voting

**Goal:** Replace binary yes/no token-weighted voting with mechanisms that give smaller holders a real voice and allow members to delegate governance to people they trust.

**DB:**
- [ ] Extend `votes` table: add `voting_method` enum (`standard`, `quadratic`, `conviction`), `raw_weight`, `conviction_multiplier`
- [ ] `vote_delegations` table (`id`, `delegator_id`, `delegate_id`, `category`, `active`, `created_at`) — per-category delegation
- [ ] `conviction_snapshots` table (`vote_id`, `weight`, `snapshotted_at`) — weight history for conviction votes
- [ ] `proposal_voting_config` column on `proposals` (`method`, `quadratic_cap`, `conviction_period_days`)

- [ ] "Voting as delegate for N members" indicator on proposal vote form
- [ ] Vote breakdown visualization on closed proposals per method

---

### Phase 23 — Portable Reputation Credential

**Goal:** Let contributors take their reputation with them. A mintable, verifiable on-chain credential that captures their XP, roles, and work history — readable by anyone without logging in.

**DB:**
- [ ] `reputation_credentials` table (`id`, `user_id`, `snapshot_data` jsonb, `mint_address`, `tx_signature`, `status` enum `pending|confirmed|failed`, `minted_at`, `refreshed_at`)

- [ ] Credential badge on profile visible to other members

---

### Phase 24 — Budget Categories + Treasury Burn Rate

**Goal:** Turn the treasury from a black box into a transparent, accountable ledger. Admins pre-allocate funds by category; every spend is linked to a budget line; the community can verify it publicly.

**DB:**
- [ ] `treasury_budgets` table (`id`, `org_id`, `epoch_id`, `category_slug`, `label`, `allocated_amount`, `currency`, `created_at`)
- [ ] Add `budget_category_id` FK to `treasury_transactions` — nullable for legacy, required for new spends

- [ ] Public treasury transparency page at `/treasury/public` — no login required, shareable link for community trust
- [ ] Required budget category selector on spending proposal form
- [ ] Category filter on transaction history list

---

### Phase 25 — Skill Endorsements + Matching

**Goal:** Make contributor skills verifiable through peer endorsement and use that data to surface the right tasks to the right people — and show admins where skill gaps are bottlenecking delivery.

**DB:**
- [ ] `skills` reference table (`slug`, `label`, `category`, `icon`) — canonical skill list
- [ ] `member_skills` table (`user_id`, `skill_slug`, `source` enum `self|endorsed`, `created_at`)
- [ ] `skill_endorsements` table (`id`, `from_user_id`, `to_user_id`, `skill_slug`, `task_id` context FK, `created_at`) — one endorsement per skill per task collaboration
- [ ] Add `required_skills` jsonb array to `tasks` table

**API:**

- [ ] Skill demand heatmap in admin analytics panel (skills in demand vs supply)
- [ ] Skill picker in onboarding wizard and profile edit (searchable, categorized)

---

### Phase 26 — Sprint Retrospectives

**Goal:** Close the feedback loop at the end of every sprint. Give contributors a structured, async space to reflect, vote on priorities, and commit to improvements before the next epoch starts.

**DB:**
- [ ] `sprint_retros` table (`id`, `sprint_id`, `status` enum `open|voting|closed`, `opened_at`, `voting_opened_at`, `closed_at`)
- [ ] `retro_entries` table (`id`, `retro_id`, `user_id`, `category` enum `went_well|improve|action`, `content`, `anonymous`, `created_at`)
- [ ] `retro_entry_votes` table (`entry_id`, `user_id`, `created_at`) — dot voting, one vote per entry per member
- [ ] `retro_commitments` table (`id`, `retro_id`, `user_id`, `content`, `resolved`, `created_at`) — carries over unresolved to next sprint

**API:**
- [ ] `POST /api/sprints/:id/retro/open` — admin (or auto-trigger on sprint close) opens retro in `open` status

- [ ] `POST /api/sprints/:id/retro/entries/:entryId/vote` — cast a dot vote
- [ ] `GET /api/sprints/:id/retro/commitments` — list commitments with carry-over flag from prior sprint

**UI:**
- [ ] Retro board with 3 columns: Went Well / Improve / Action Items — sticky note style cards
- [ ] Anonymous entry toggle per submission
- [ ] Voting phase UI: dot allocation (each member gets N dots), live vote count visible after voting closes
- [ ] Commitments section below the board — list of action items with owner and resolved toggle
- [ ] "Carry forward" indicator on unresolved commitments from the previous sprint
- [ ] Summary card on sprint history page: top 2 items per column + commitment count
- [ ] Notification to all sprint members when retro opens and when voting begins

### Phase 27 — Multi-DAO / DAO Discovery (SaaS Layer)

**Goal:** Make Organic a platform, not just a product. Let multiple communities run on shared infrastructure, let contributors carry their identity across DAOs, and let new communities onboard in minutes with pre-built templates.

> **Dependency:** Requires Phase 20 (onboarding), Phase 23 (portable credential), Phase 25 (skills) to be stable first. This is the largest scope change in the roadmap — confirm approach before starting.

- [ ] Add `org_id` FK to all core tables (tasks, proposals, sprints, members, treasury, etc.) — phased migration required
- [ ] `org_members` table (`org_id`, `user_id`, `role`, `joined_at`) — replaces single-community member model
- [ ] `org_templates` table (`slug`, `name`, `description`, `preset_config` jsonb) — pre-configured task categories, quest packs, role structures

**API:**
- [ ] `GET /api/orgs/discover` — public discovery feed, filterable by category, chain, member count
- [ ] `GET /api/orgs/:slug` — public org profile (no auth)
- [ ] `POST /api/orgs` — create new org (super-admin or approved tier gated)
- [ ] `GET /api/orgs/:slug/join` — verify token + apply to join
- [ ] `GET /api/users/:id/orgs` — list all orgs a user belongs to with roles
- [ ] Update middleware to resolve `org_id` from subdomain (`slug.organic.app`) or URL path param on all requests
- [ ] `GET /api/users/:id/cross-org-summary` — aggregate contributions across all orgs for unified profile

**UI:**
- [ ] DAO discovery page at `/discover` — public, no login required, card grid with search and filters (chain, category, size)
- [ ] DAO creation wizard: name → token configuration → template selection → role setup → invite first members
- [ ] DAO template picker: Dev DAO / Media DAO / Investment DAO / Custom (pre-fills quest packs, task categories, role names)
- [ ] Org switcher in navigation header (for members in multiple orgs)
- [ ] Unified profile page: cross-org contribution summary, per-org role badges
- [ ] Admin billing/tier management page (for future monetization)
